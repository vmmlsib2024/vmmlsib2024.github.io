<h2 style="text-align: center;">Visualization in the Moment of Machine Learning</h2>
<p>We are happy to invite you to attend the 1st Workshop on Visualization in the Moment of Machine Learning (VMML). VMML 2024 will be held as part of SIBGRAPI 2024 in <span style="font-weight: 400;">Manaus, the Amazon state capital, from September 30th to October 3rd.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The workshop will discuss challenges and opportunities in the context of visualization and machine learning (ML), such as: What should the role of visualization be after the first era of machine learning? Can visualization support further development of human thinking, as a countermeasure against ML-induced laziness and degeneration of the mind? What are the best ways to merge machine learning and visualization? How can visualization help schools and education in this era?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Answers to these questions can help reshape the role of visualization research and how it will impact industry and society. The workshop aims to gather researchers, students, and visualization practitioners to identify issues and elaborate possible ways for their solutions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The workshop is structured into three sessions, of which the first one aims to collect issues, the second collects possible solutions to the identified issues, and in the third session, a document (white paper) will be set up for publication. </span></p>
